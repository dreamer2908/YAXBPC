Hi there! Yes, you!

In short:
- Move your original file (&sourcefile&) into this folder, or this folder's parent folder. For example: all these patches, scripts, xdelta3 binaries, how_to_appply_this_patch.txt are in folder Entertain/Animu/Nourin/patch_ep_01_v2. You should put it in either patch_ep_01_v2, Nourin, Animu, or Entertain. These scripts will first look for it in patch_ep_01_v2; if it can't find it there, it will look in Nourin, and then Animu, and finally Entertain. If the file can't be found in these four location, the scripts will give up. Please don't troll these poor scripts. Thanks.
- Run the applying script written for your operating system: for Windows, apply_patch_windows.bat; for Linux/Unix, apply_patch_linux.sh; for Mac OSX, apply_patch_mac.command.
- Alternative, you can drag-n-drop your original file onto the applying script. You don't need to move your file as told above if you choose this way. Only available in YAXBPC v2.1.0 or later.
- Check if a new file was created (&targetfile&). If true, you're successful, so stop here.
- If not, try the alternative script and check the output again. Comment: if used correctly, only windows scripts in legacy versions of windows have some real chance of failure. Otherwise, it shouldn't fail at all.
- If the alternative script fails, redo carefully from the first step.
- If nothing worked, you can resort to manual patching. Feel free to use any xdelta3 GUI if you don't like the following steps.
    + Move your original file (&sourcefile&) into this folder (the one where all these patches, scripts, xdelta3 binaries, how_to_appply_this_patch.txt are).
    + Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Linux, Unix, Mac OSX). Change working directory to this folder. On Windows Explorer, you might want to right click in a blank area while pressing Shift to quickly do this step.
    + Copy and paste this line there, then press Enter: xdelta3 -d -f -s "&sourcefile&" "changes.vcdiff" "&targetfile&"
    + Done. Hint to users who think they know how to use xdelta3 and insist to run "xdelta3 -d changes.vcdiff": filenames stored in changes.vcdiff are not guaranteed to be correct, as the patch might have been created in a different type of system (Win32 vs. Linux, Win32 vs. Mac OSX) so xdelta3 might be unable to decode these filenames, or it might have been created "funnily" where filenames are replaced with garbage.

You might want to check for some system requirements:
- A *working* computer.
- A *working* and *modern* PC operating system (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OSX).
- These common OSes are officially supported and fully tested: Windows 7, Windows 10, Linux Mint 17.3, and whatever Mac OSX in 2014.
- For Windows: Nothing prevents the script from executing the binary file xdelta3.exe (stupid antivirus for example). This patch makes heavy use of PowerShell when possible. It is installed by default in Windows 7 and later. If you're on Windows XP or Vista, please install it manually (see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/968929 ).
- For Mac OSX: A pretty old (2014) 64-bit Mac OSX binary is bundled with the patch. If your OSX installation is 32-bit or the binary doesn't work on your new OSX, please install xdelta3 package. WinE on OSX might work, but it has never been tested.
- For Linux: Either xdelta3 package installed [recommended], WinE package installed, or included Linux binaries' permission set to executable. Your shell should be bash or dash; sh still works as long as you don't "source" the script.
- For FreeBSD and other Unix-/Linux-like OS: Either xdelta3 package installed [recommended] or WinE package installed. The requirement for shell is the same as above. Recent versions of FreeBSD can run the bundled Linux binaries if the Linux compatability layer is enabled and the required libraries (linux_base-c6 package and liblzma.so.5) are installed. However, it's difficult to quickly determine if they can really run perfectly on your, yes your, specific system. Hence, they're not used, and the xdelta3 binary installed in the system is used instead.
- If you don't want to, or somehow can't use the bundled xdelta3 binaries, feel free to delete them and install xdelta3 on your system. The patch will use your system binaries instead.
- Make sure that no program is accessing the original file (&sourcefile&) and any files in this patch. This is not a strict requirement, but patching might fail otherwise.
